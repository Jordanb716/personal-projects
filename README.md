Sudoku Solver

A command line program that takes incomplete sudokus, either manually input,
	or from a text file, and can solve them using recursion. Also has a simple
	'play' mode that lets you enter numbers with immediate feedback. Has the
	beginnings of another solve mode based on trying to emulate actual play,
	turned out to be overly complex on the initial attempt.

Instructions:
	Compile the code using the provided makefile.
	Run the resulting executable, optionally with the name of a sudoku-containing text file as an argument, then follow the instructions.
	If no text file is provided, the program will start in manual entry mode, and provide instructions.
