Personal projects of Jordan Bergmann:

================================================================================

Sudoku Solver: (C, Complete, Functional)
	A command line program that takes incomplete sudokus, either manually input,
	or from a text file, and can solve them using recursion. Also has a simple
	'play' mode that lets you enter numbers with immediate feedback. Has the
	beginnings of another solve mode based on trying to emulate actual play,
	turned out to be overly complex on the initial attempt.

Pathfinder Character Generator: (C, In rework, possibly nonfunctional)
	A command line program that generates stats and simple background for
	Pathfinder characters. Currently rewriting to include random generation of
	race and region of birth based on population statistics.

guessing_game: (Rust, TEMP)
	Program from Rust tutorial.

Population Difference Sim: (C, Messy, Nonfunctional)
	Simple program to try to recreate a population interaction simulation
	described by Axelrod that claimed to produce highly differentiated
	population zones purely through a mechanism of neighbers randomly becoming
	more alike, with higher probability of interaction if already similar.
