	A command line program that takes incomplete sudokus, either manually input,
	or from a text file, and can solve them. Also has a simple 'play' mode that
	lets you enter numbers with immediate feedback.

Pathfinder Character Generator:
	A command line program that generates stats and simple background for
	Pathfinder characters.
